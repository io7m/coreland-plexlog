<p>
This package provides a means for an unlimited number of cooperating processes
to safely log to a single directory. Log rotation is entirely automatic and will
never exceed a given space limit. No daemon processes are required.
</p>
<p>
The package is implemented as a tiny C library (less than 500 lines) for easy
embedding into any program.
</p>
<p>
Bindings to the library from multiple languages are available.
